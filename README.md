# Chatter Hub

Chatter Hub is a real-time chat application developed using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows multiple users to engage in live chat sessions, facilitated by socket connections. This project showcases the integration of [Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) for WebSocket-based communication and Node.js for server-side logic.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Multiple Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Enables bi-directional event-based communication between clients and server.
- **User Tracking**: Keeps track of active users and updates the user list dynamically.
- **Broadcasting**: Messages are broadcasted to all users in real-time.
- **Simple and Clean Interface**: Designed for ease of use and minimalistic user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
